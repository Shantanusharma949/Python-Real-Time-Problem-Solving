QUESTION:-

Both players are given the same string, .
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string .
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

Scoring
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string .

For Example:
String  = BANANA
Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.

Sample Input

BANANA
Sample Output

Stuart 12



SOLUTION:-

def minion_game(string):
    # your code goes here
    player1 = 0;
    player2 = 0;
    str_len = len(string)
    for i in range(str_len):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            player1 += (str_len)-i
        else :
            player2 += (str_len)-i
    
    if player1 > player2:
        print("Kevin", player1)
    elif player1 < player2:
        print("Stuart",player2)
    elif player1 == player2:
        print("Draw")
    else :
        print("Draw")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    minion_game(s)
